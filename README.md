## General Info

This app is a sudoku game. A login page appears for the user to get into their profile, then a presentation of the game is made and the player can afterwards play.


## Steps

In this sectinon are listed the different steps took during the developing process:

* Design of a low-fidelity wireframe.
* Design of a high-fidelity wireframe.
* Implementation of the UI of the LogIn.vue page.
* Implementation of the UI of the SignUp.vue page.
* Implementation of routers for navigation between LogIn and SignUp.
* Implementation of the UI of HomePage.vue and Presentation.vue.
* Implementation of routers between pages.
* Creation of the Game file.
* Implementation of the grid.

## Issues Encountered

I faced some challenges/issues during the process.

* Routers did not want to work at first, the method I was first using is deprecated.
* The creation of the Grid without using a method too long (writing each line) is very time consuming to find a solution.
